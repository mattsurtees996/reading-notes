#### Wireframe - Deisgning a web layout before HTML

## Structuring your HTML

Within your HTML there are 2 main components;
  - Head:  What the browser uses to create your browser page (behind the scences)
  
  - Body:  This is what you see on your browser page
    - Within the body you have 3 main areas;
        - Header 
        - Main
        - Footer

Within the different sections you can add images, navigation menu's, paragraphs etc.
